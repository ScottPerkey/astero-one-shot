If you have MESA data in the current working directory, then you can compute th\
e large freq. separation by doing:
python -m nonad.plot_modes profile3.data --plot
which will result in output like:
profile3.data.astero.in
which contains the large freq. separation (both the scaling relation version an\
d the actual modelled version)
as well as a plot called:
profile3.data_freqs.png
showing what those frequencies look like in comparison to the red giant branch \
pattern.

*w_damping.png
made by setting use_eta and damping_thresh > -np.inf (used 0, but could be anything else)
*w_vis.png
made by turning off use_eta and by using damping_thresh > -np.inf (used 0, but could be anything else)
