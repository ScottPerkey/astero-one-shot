1		; if 1, then .globalpars and .bgfitpars files will be replaced and overwritten; if 0, then .globalpars and .bgfitspars will be appended to, skipping any of the objects that are already present in .globalpars. assumes .findex, .globalpars, .bgfitspars, and .ranges are all in alignment when SYD is called --.globalpars cannot be one object ahead of .bgfitpars, for example.
0		; if 1, just do a replot. this will means that .bgfitpars and .globalpars files are not overwritten, just the .sp.gif files are remade with expected values of things, etc., etc. MUST ALSO SET ABOVE OPTION TO 1 (replace). don't worry, it won't replace your files.
0		; if 1, do a bayesian dnu calculation. if 0, do not do a dnu calculation
